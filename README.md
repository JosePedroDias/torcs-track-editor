# Motivation

I got frustrated with the GUI and limitations of the track editor that comes bundled with TORCS.
After using it a bit and reading the scarse documentation on the format, I tried to render existing tracks
with JS and rendering it to a canvas in the browser.

The project may span in multiple directions from here.
I may try to support rendering additional properties and improve the precision of the rendering.
I may expose the track features as abstract vertices so they can be rendered in several impls (ex: webgl).
I may create an editing interface so one can edit existing or create new tracks.
