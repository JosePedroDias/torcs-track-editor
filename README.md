# Motivation

I got frustrated with the GUI and limitations of the track editor that comes bundled with TORCS.
After using it a bit and reading the scarse documentation on the format, I tried to render existing tracks
with JS and rendering it to a canvas in the browser.

# Tentative Roadmap

* finish bg loading feature
* add input type file to allow loading tracks with ease
* save track button
* try to correct precision issues (most tracks don't end closed as they should, probably due to curve interpolation misinterpretation of something)
